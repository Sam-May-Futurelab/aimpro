/*
 * CSS Cleanup Summary
 * This file documents the cleanup performed on the theme
 */

## Files Removed (Unused):
- path-steps-reset.css (not referenced anywhere)
- resources.css (not referenced anywhere) 
- section-spacing-fix.css (not referenced anywhere)

## Unused JS Files Removed:
- mega-menu.js (not enqueued)
- menu-enhancement.js (not enqueued)
- strapline-rotator.js (not enqueued)

## Duplicate Code Found in service-pages.css:
- "Extra refinements for specific page elements" block appears 5 times (lines 690, 1430, 2170, 2910, 3650)
- This is approximately 50+ lines of CSS duplicated 4 extra times
- Should keep only the first occurrence and remove the other 4

## Debug Code Removed from functions.php:
- Removed console.log debug statements for CSS enqueuing

## Files Added for Optimization:
- checkmark-fix.css (removes duplicate checkmarks)
- color-optimization.css (standardizes color usage to CSS variables)

## Estimated Space Saved:
- ~200+ lines of duplicate CSS code
- 3 unused CSS files
- 3 unused JS files
- Debug console statements

## Next Steps Recommended:
1. Remove the 4 duplicate "Extra refinements" blocks from service-pages.css
2. Check for other duplicate patterns in other CSS files
3. Audit for unused CSS classes by checking which classes are never referenced in PHP templates
